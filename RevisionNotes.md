Here is the PCB layout 
Also an updated Schematic
Please check them over and get back to me
I am always paranoid now that the express pcb software
is gonna leave something unattached.

However I think it is OK. there are a few parts that may not be necessary
and if so we can leave them off the boards (IE the resonator, could use rc)
but I put them in so we could potentially use this board for something else
in the future, also put a small BB area in, for future mods, let me know if anything
needs changed, I should be available some today.

I am beginning on the program, but still have to find a suitable compiler.

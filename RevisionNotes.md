dude finally got my emulator working on my pc at shop.
but it seems like I remember the thing won't work with an rc, 
so will try to find my 4mhz crystal for tomorrow.
got the simulator working also, and found a couple small bugs
so attached are the new files to try, ran it for a 4m xtal so make that change
for now on prototype. we can adjust it after debugging for and with back for production

bt.

P.S. no file name change so get rid of old versions

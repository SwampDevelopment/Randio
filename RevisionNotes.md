OK
Here are the new files for Randio version 2.
There is a slight change in the schematic in that I added a diode to the reset circuit  to
insure that it will reset quickly on power glitches.
quite a bit of re routes on the pcb, check it out and let me know if you see anything
that needs further attention.

These are as much final as possible, I had to do a small change to the pcb
in that the RC OSC for the PIC is different than the motorola part
it requires an actual RC IE. a cap(220PF) so I added that
if you use a redo its a non issue if rc though a slight mod is required from the layout I sent last week.
also reflected this in the schematic.

The program should work, but haven't tested yet, other than sim, and that is acting squirrley at the moment.
if it don't work don't worry I will debug today as soon as I get a break. but have to go and pull a location
this morning so bear with me, but let me know what the status is.

Talk to ya in a while
